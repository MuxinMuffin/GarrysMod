Hello!

This repo will host everything related to Garry's Mod (maps, instances, props, textures, etc.)
It will only include original assets, custom assets used from other games or UGC will not be directly provided.

# Notes
As of now this is a public repo.

# Terms of Use
1) For Garry's Mod only, you are allowed to upload deriatives of my work on the Steam Workshop, you may upload anywhere else too.
2) All map uploads should state that it is unaffiliated with the official map in its description, as well as a link to the Steam Workshop original map.
3) You must add your own suffix after the official filename. Official example: rp_stmonika_v1a, can be suffixed as rp_stmonika_v1a_myedit. Do not name it in a way as if it were an official version of the map, such as rp_stmonika_v1b, v2, etc)
4) Do not try to profit from the vmf or any original work here on the GMod store or anywhere else. Maps should be free for everyone.

I don't recommend editing my maps unless you know what you're doing.
I will not provide help for the hundreds of possible errors you could face trying to change anything meaningful.
UGC not included can be extracted using BSPSource and your own wit to help you.
Beyond that, you can use my VMF to learn for yourself, I encourage it.
